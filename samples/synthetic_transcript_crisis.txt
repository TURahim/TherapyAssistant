Session Number: 4

Therapist: Morgan, thank you for coming in on short notice. On the phone you mentioned you were having a really difficult day. Can you tell me what's going on?

Client: I don't know if I can do this anymore. Everything feels hopeless.

Therapist: I'm hearing that you're in a lot of pain right now. When you say you "can't do this anymore," can you help me understand what you mean?

Client: I just... I'm so tired. Work is terrible, I got passed over for the promotion again. My relationship ended last month. I feel like nothing ever goes right for me.

Therapist: That's a lot of loss and disappointment in a short time. I can see why you're feeling overwhelmed. Morgan, I need to ask you directly - are you having any thoughts of suicide or hurting yourself?

Client: I've been thinking about it. Not like I have a plan or anything. But sometimes I think everyone would be better off without me.

Therapist: Thank you for being honest with me. That takes courage. Those thoughts are a sign of how much pain you're in, not a sign that the thought is true. When did these thoughts start?

Client: A few days ago. After I found out about the promotion.

Therapist: Have you thought about how you might hurt yourself?

Client: No, not really. I just keep thinking about disappearing. Not being here.

Therapist: I hear you. Have you ever attempted suicide before or had these thoughts this strongly in the past?

Client: Never attempted. I thought about it once in college, but I talked to a counselor and it passed.

Therapist: I'm glad you reached out then, and I'm really glad you reached out today. That shows strength. Right now, my priority is making sure you're safe. Do you have access to any means to hurt yourself at home - medications, firearms, anything like that?

Client: I have some old pain medication from when I hurt my back. I've thought about those.

Therapist: Okay. I want to talk with you about removing access to those. Can we make a plan for you to give those to someone you trust, or bring them to a pharmacy for disposal?

Client: I guess I could give them to my sister. She lives nearby.

Therapist: That's a great idea. Can you do that today, before you go home?

Client: Yes, I can call her after this.

Therapist: Good. Now I want to ask - do you feel safe enough to go home tonight, or do you feel like you might act on these thoughts?

Client: I think I'm okay. I don't want to actually do it. I just... the thoughts are scary.

Therapist: The thoughts are scary, and they're also a symptom of depression and overwhelming stress. They don't define you. Let's make a safety plan together. If the thoughts get stronger, what will you do?

Client: Call you? Or the crisis line you gave me before.

Therapist: Yes. The crisis line is 988. And you can call my office anytime - if it's after hours, there's always someone on call. What else can you do if you're struggling?

Client: Maybe go to my sister's house. She always makes me feel better.

Therapist: Having that support is so important. I want you to reach out to her today - not just to give her the medication, but to tell her you're having a hard time. You don't have to share everything if you don't want to.

Client: Okay. I can do that.

Therapist: I'm also going to recommend we increase our sessions to twice weekly until you're feeling more stable. How does that sound?

Client: That would actually help. I've been feeling so alone.

Therapist: You're not alone in this, Morgan. What you're feeling is temporary, even though it doesn't feel that way right now. With support and treatment, these feelings will ease.

Client: I hope so.

Therapist: Before you leave, let's write down your safety plan. And I want to schedule our next session for the day after tomorrow. Can you commit to staying safe until then?

Client: Yes. I can do that.

Therapist: Thank you, Morgan. Let's work through this together.
