Session Number: 1

Therapist: Welcome, Alex. I'm glad you could make it today. How are you feeling about being here?

Client: Honestly, a bit nervous. I've never been to therapy before, but my doctor thought it might help with the anxiety I've been experiencing.

Therapist: That's completely understandable. Many people feel nervous at first. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?

Client: Well, for the past few months, I've been having trouble sleeping, my heart races sometimes for no reason, and I find myself worrying constantly about work and... well, everything really.

Therapist: That sounds really challenging. When did you first start noticing these symptoms?

Client: It started getting bad around September when I got a promotion at work. The new responsibilities have been overwhelming.

Therapist: Congratulations on the promotion, and also thank you for sharing that. It's not uncommon for positive life changes to also bring stress. What does a typical day look like for you now?

Client: I wake up already thinking about my to-do list. I skip breakfast because I'm too anxious to eat. Work is non-stop meetings and decisions. By the time I get home, I'm exhausted but can't wind down.

Therapist: I hear you. It sounds like anxiety is affecting multiple areas of your life - your sleep, eating, and ability to relax. What are some things that have helped, even a little?

Client: Jamie, my partner, has been really supportive. And I've tried meditation apps, but I can't seem to focus long enough to use them.

Therapist: Having a supportive partner is a wonderful strength. And it's great that you've already tried some self-help strategies. In our work together, we can build on that.

Client: What do you think we can do? I really want to feel like myself again.

Therapist: Based on what you've shared, I'd like to suggest we work on understanding your anxiety patterns first. We'll use some cognitive-behavioral techniques to help you identify triggers and develop coping strategies. Does that sound okay?

Client: Yes, that sounds helpful. I'm willing to try anything at this point.

Therapist: That motivation is important. Before we end today, let me ask - have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or others?

Client: No, nothing like that. I'm just stressed and anxious, but I'm not having those kinds of thoughts.

Therapist: Thank you for being open with me. That's important to check. Let's schedule our next session for next week. In the meantime, I'd like you to start noticing when you feel most anxious - just observe, don't try to change anything yet.

Client: I can do that. Thank you for listening today. I feel a little better just talking about it.

Therapist: I'm glad. That's what we're here for. See you next week, Alex.
