Session Number: 2

Therapist: Good to see you again, Alex. How has your week been since our last session?

Client: Better in some ways. I told Jamie about coming here and they were really supportive. But I had a panic attack at work on Wednesday.

Therapist: I'm glad you have Jamie's support. Can you tell me more about what happened Wednesday?

Client: I was about to present to the executive team and suddenly I couldn't breathe. I had to step out and collect myself. It was embarrassing.

Therapist: First, I want to acknowledge how difficult that must have been. Panic attacks can feel very scary. Let's talk about what was going through your mind in that moment.

Client: I kept thinking "I'm going to mess this up" and "everyone will see I'm not qualified for this job."

Therapist: Those are what we call automatic negative thoughts. They feel very real in the moment, but they're often not accurate reflections of reality. Did anything happen after you collected yourself?

Client: Actually, I went back in and did the presentation. It wasn't perfect, but my boss said it was good.

Therapist: That's really important to notice. Your mind told you that you'd fail, but the reality was different. This is something we can work with.

Client: I never thought about it that way.

Therapist: Today I'd like to introduce you to a technique called cognitive restructuring. When you notice a thought like "I'm going to mess this up," I want you to ask yourself three questions.

Client: Okay, what are they?

Therapist: First, what's the evidence for this thought? Second, what's the evidence against it? And third, what would I tell a friend who had this thought?

Client: That makes sense. I guess the evidence against it is that I've given successful presentations before. And I got this promotion because they believe in me.

Therapist: Exactly. You're already doing the work. Did you do the homework I suggested - noticing when you feel anxious?

Client: Yes! I found that mornings are the worst. And Sunday nights too, when I start thinking about the week ahead.

Therapist: That's excellent awareness. Knowing your patterns is the first step to changing them. Let's talk about some morning routines that might help...

Client: I'd like that. I also noticed I feel better after I exercise, but I've been skipping the gym because I'm "too busy."

Therapist: I notice you used air quotes there. Do you think that's actually true?

Client: Honestly? No. I think I'm avoiding it because by the time I consider going, I'm already anxious and tired.

Therapist: That's a great insight. Exercise is actually one of the most effective ways to manage anxiety. What if we made it a priority rather than something optional?

Client: Like scheduling it like a meeting?

Therapist: Exactly. What time works best for you?

Client: Mornings, probably. Before the anxiety kicks in.

Therapist: Let's make that part of your plan for this week. Exercise three mornings, practice the cognitive restructuring when you notice anxious thoughts, and continue noting your patterns.

Client: That feels manageable. I'll try it.

Therapist: Remember, we're not aiming for perfection. We're building skills. How are you feeling right now?

Client: Hopeful. More hopeful than last week.

Therapist: That's wonderful to hear. Same time next week?

Client: Yes, I'll be here. Thank you.
